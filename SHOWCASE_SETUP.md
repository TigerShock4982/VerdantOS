# Showcase Setup

This setup uses an Arduino Uno R3 over USB serial as the live sensor source.

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Supabase Table

Create the table by running the SQL in:

```bash
supabase/sensor_events.sql
```

You can paste it into the Supabase SQL editor. It creates `sensor_events` with parsed sensor columns, `raw_text`, and indexes for latest-row reads.

## Environment

Put these values in `.env.local`:

```bash
SERIAL_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0
SERIAL_BAUD=9600
DEVICE_ID=arduino-uno-r3-1
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-server-only-service-role-key
```

`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is used only by the local serial bridge for inserts. The deployed dashboard can read with the publishable key fallback in the app code. Do not prefix the service role key with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

## Find Arduino Uno R3 Serial Port On Fedora KDE

Connect the Arduino Uno R3 over USB, then check that Fedora sees the USB device:

```bash
lsusb
```

Check available serial ports:

```bash
ls /dev/ttyACM* /dev/ttyUSB*
```

Watch plug-in logs if the port is unclear:

```bash
sudo dmesg -w
```

Use the detected port as `SERIAL_PORT`. The default is `/dev/ttyACM0`, but an Uno R3 may also appear as `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

If the port exists but cannot be opened, add your user to the serial group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
```

Then log out and back in.

## Run The Bridge

```bash
npm run bridge:serial
```

The bridge reads complete Arduino blocks ending in `-----------------------------------`, parses them, converts `light_ppfd = light_lux / 54`, and inserts one row per block into Supabase.

That PPFD conversion is approximate and depends on the grow light spectrum.

## Run The App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the local Next.js URL. The Dashboard polls `/api/sensor-events/latest`, which safely reads Supabase on the server. The browser never receives the service role key.

## Full Showcase Flow

1. Arduino Uno R3 runs `Sensors.ino` at `9600` baud and prints a sensor block about every 2 seconds.
2. Laptop runs `npm run bridge:serial`.
3. Bridge parses each full serial block and inserts into Supabase `sensor_events`.
4. Dashboard polls the server API route for the newest event.
5. Dashboard displays the latest readings, PPFD light value, last updated time, and a stale indicator when the newest row is older than about 10 seconds.
